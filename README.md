### About this Dataset

**Context**: Now that this year’s IPL is over, let’s not curb our cricket love and start analyzing the whole of IPL with this latest and complete IPL dataset. IT contains the match descriptions, results, winners, player of the matches, ball by ball dataset and much more. So, stop thinking and start analyzing.

### Content

This dataset consists of two separate CSV files: matches and deliveries. These files contain the information of each match summary and ball by ball details, respectively.

- **IPL Ball-by-Ball 2008-2020.csv**: Contains the ball-by-ball data of the whole Indian Premier League tournament.
- **IPL Matches 2008-2020.csv**: Contains summary for every match in the tournament.

### Table of contents
- Import the required libraries
- Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data visualization
- Data Standardization
- IPL win probability using suitable ML algorithm
- Win probability for 2021 from existing data

## Project 2: Python Project - Send Automatic Emails using Python

### Content

Every time you register on a new app, you automatically receive a welcome message with your name on it. If you want to learn how to send such emails automatically, then this article is for you.

You will automatically send a welcome message to the newly registered user. For this task, you must first generate a google app password for your Gmail account. Once you’ve generated your Google app password, you can start the task of sending emails using Python by writing the logic for code.

### Password Authentication using Python

**Content**: Password Authentication is the process of checking the identity of a user. Almost every online platform today makes sure that they only give access to the real user which can be only possible by asking for a password while a user wants to log in to the account

To create a password authentication system using Python you have to follow the steps mentioned below:

1. Create a dictionary of usernames with their passwords.
2. Then you have to ask for user input as the username by using the input function in Python.
3. Then you have to use the getpass module in Python to ask for user input as the password. Here we are using the getpass module instead of the input function to make sure that the user doesn’t get to see what he/she write in the password field.

## Project 3: Flipkart Reviews Sentiment Analysis using Python

Flipkart is one of the most popular Indian companies. It is an e-commerce platform that competes with popular e-commerce platforms like Amazon. One of the most popular use cases of data science is the task of sentiment analysis of product reviews sold on e-commerce platforms.

## Project 4: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Credit card fraud is more common than you think, and lately, they’ve been on the rise. We’re on the path to cross a billion credit card users by the end of 2022. But thanks to the innovations in technologies like artificial intelligence, machine learning and data science, credit card companies have been able to successfully identify and intercept these frauds with sufficient accuracy.

Simply put, the idea behind this is to analyse the customer’s usual spending behaviour, including mapping the location of those spendings to identify the fraudulent transactions from the non-fraudulent ones. For this project, you can use either R or Python with the customer’s transaction history as the data set and ingest it into decision trees, artificial neural networks, and logistic regression. As you feed more data to your system, you should be able to increase its overall accuracy.
